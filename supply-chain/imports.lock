- migrating match patterns to take advantage of default bindings mode from RFC 2005
Either way, the result is code that does exactly the same thing and does not change the risk of UB.

WARNING: This certification is a result of a **partial** audit.  The
`any_zlib` code has **not** been audited.  Ability to track partial
audits is tracked in https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/380
Chromium does use the `any_zlib` feature(s).  Accidentally depending on
this feature in the future is prevented using the `ban_features` feature
of `gnrt` - see:
https://crrev.com/c/4723145/31/third_party/rust/chromium_crates_io/gnrt_config.toml

Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at
(Google-internal, sorry): go/image-crate-chromium-security-review

I grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bfs\b'`, `'\bnet\b'`, `'\bunsafe\b'`.

All `unsafe` in `flate2` is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "any_zlib")]`:

* The code under `src/ffi/...` will not be used because the `mod c`
  declaration in `src/ffi/mod.rs` depends on the `any_zlib` config
* 7 uses of `unsafe` in `src/mem.rs` also all depend on the
  `any_zlib` config:
    - 2 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 2 in `fn set_level` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 3 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Decompress`)

All hits of `'\bfs\b'` are in comments, or example code, or test code
(but not in product code).

There were no hits of `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bnet\b'`.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.
